# Why Do Schools Perform Low? Identifying Key Predictors of North Carolina School Performance through Machine Learning :eyes:

This repository stores the project materials for the course **ORLA 6541:  Data Science for Organizations and Leadership** at Teachers College, Columbia University. The project utilzied access and opportunity data to predict school performance. 

In most accountability system, school performance is usually evaluated by test scores and lacks the consideration of school resources. Therefore, this project aims to consider the previous reserachers' suggestions regarding expanding accountability to more indicators by utilizing machine learning techniques. The logic is if school performance can be predicted by those predictors, that means those school characteristics have a impact on students' test performance and thus school performance. With variable importance index, school leaders can be informed about where to work on as priority to improve their school perforamnce.
